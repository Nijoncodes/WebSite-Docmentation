        <p> Vega Bond is a anime manga that was first serailized in 1998. The manga teaches many
         philosophical values to young man who hold those values even today. Vega Bond teaches men
         to have a bit of self improvement in their life. To stop holding things such as grudges and hate. Forgiveness
         is the true thing we sould embrace. It teaches us to be better and kinder men. The main character of Vega bond is
         based off a real person who lived. His name was Musashi Miyamoto. He was a japanese philospher who slayed 61 men in combat.
         His main teahchings were inner calmness, acceptance, and displine. Their might be some days where you might not feel like doing
         anything. No matter how you feel there is always work to be done each and every day. Kindness is the key to life. Without Kindness
         you won't get anywhere in life. A man will never truly become stronger without kindness in his heart.

         <p>


           Due to the effect of Vega bond many men are now self imrproving themselves inlcuding me. Many men are hitting the gym now.
           Some men are reading 10 to 30 mintues everyday to gain knowledge. I think the effect of Vega Bond has taught men to be the best
           versions of themselves. The number one lession is that we should all carry love and kindess in our hearts. We should strive for change.

                These three Senin Japenese manga has had a big influence on young men. Including myself.
                By reading these mangas we have been taught about different idealologys and philosphys. Finding new path ways to life.
                Wether that be through hardships or not. We can improve our life with just a smile. We ca'nt control what happens to our lifes.
                However, we can control how we can react to it. The only person you are obligated to make happy is your self. Always remember.
                Smiling cost 0$.
